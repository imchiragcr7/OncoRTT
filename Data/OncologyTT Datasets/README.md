##### OncologyTT Datasets have been created for research purposes to contribute to Oncology research, more specifically "Identifying novel therapeutic targets to treat cancer.

----------------------------------------------------
### Description of all folders:
1. Positive targets (Approved target)
2. Positive genes (Cancer driver genes) 
3. Negative genes (unlabeled genes where we consider negative samples)
4. Combined genes (combine all three genes types: positive genes, positive targets, and negative genes) that consist of several files for all cancer types, that have the same order of all embeddings.
5. OMICS: include gene expression and gene mutation features for all genes in each cancer type
