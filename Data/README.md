# 1 - OncologyTT Datasets

### "OncologyTT" Datasets have been created for research purposes to contribute to Oncology research
(more specifically "Identifying novel therapeutic targets to treat cancer).

This dataset has been used in tow purposes:
* to compare OncoRTT with satate-of-the-art method, and
* as unseen test data to predict novel threupetic targets.
#### The published research article for the baseline method:
